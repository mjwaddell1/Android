Stock scanner app for Android

-- Main purpose of application

TrendScan allows users to enter a list of stocks to watch. Every 30 minutes the price history of each stock is downloaded and a scan filter is run to check if the price history matches a desired trend (i.e -10% change over 5 days). Multiple filters are supported.

-- Notes

This project was created using Android Studio 2.3.1.

The price data feed is provided by IEX Trading. The API documentation can be found here: https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/

IEX provides 5 years of chart data, but the app only stores the last 6 months to reduce memory load.

The app targets my phone - a Samsung J7 (720p).
