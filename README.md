Stock scanner app for Android

-- Main purpose of application

TrendScan allows users to enter a list of stocks to watch. Every 30 minutes the price history of each stock is downloaded and a scan filter is run to check if the price history matches a desired trend (i.e -10% change over 5 days). Multiple filters are supported.

-- Notes

This project was created using Android Studio 2.3.1.

The price data feed is provided by Alpha Advantage. The user will need to get an API key from Alpha to usew the app. The key is free and can be acquired here: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

Alpha provides 20 years of data, but the app only stores the last 6 months to reduce memory.

The company name lookup uses my website to check a static stock list for a given symbol. I highly recommend finding another site to get this data from as I will probably change my site.

The app targets my phone - a Samsung J7 (720p).
